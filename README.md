# Unifica Lab

Notebook-driven data integration.

This project is starting life using components from [Biff][biff], which we use
for our customer-facing application.

Turns out that Biff has a lot of non-Web code that's useful, such as the
configuration and module / component system.

Adapting these system to the data science use case is helping me learn Clojure,
learn Biff, and solve real customer problems.
